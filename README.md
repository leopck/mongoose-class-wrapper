# mongoose-class-wrapper

Just a simple wrapper class for Mongoose NodeJS (MEAN stack)

Problem statement:
I wanted to initialize all the schema, models, connections, insertion and finding from another class so that my app.js(main function) only has to call one object and it'll perform all the tedious task, leaving me to fill in the missing things only.
